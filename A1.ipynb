        "       The article: “Eigenfaces vs. Fisherfaces: Recognition Using Class Specific Linear Projection” was written by Peter N. Belhumeur, Joao P. Hespanha, and David J. Kriegman in 1997. The article mainly focused on the newly proposed face recognition algorithm. The aim of the test is to demonstrate how the new face recognition algorithm works even if the image is under intense variety of light and face expressions and to reveal the results the authors had found and what problems were faced when conducting the experiments. This article consists both the positive and negative sides.\n",

Due to the variety of lightning in photos, the face of one person can appear differently on two photos, though the face expressions are identical. To be able to identify a person in unlabeled facial images using set of labeled images, four methods were applied: Correlation, Eigenfaces, Linear Subspaces and Fisherfaces.\n",

The second dataset was constructed at Yale with images taken from the same angle but with different facial expression and lighting, sample image from the second dataset are shown in figure 2.\n",

After experimenting, the authors had concluded their finding by proposed the Fisherfaces method, which appeared to be the best at face recognition with variation in lighting and facial expression. However, the authors also stated that the proposed algorithm might be used in a variation of lighting direction, but the algorithm may likely to break down under extreme lighting conditions."
