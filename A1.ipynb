After experimenting, the authors had concluded their finding by proposed the Fisherfaces method, which appeared to be the best at face recognition with variation in lighting and facial expression. However, the authors also stated that the proposed algorithm might be used in a variation of lighting direction, but the algorithm may likely to break down under extreme lighting conditions."

The first experiment conducted with the Harvard dataset, the dataset contains 5 subsets, each subset had different lighting. The second experiment conducted with the Yale dataset; however, in the second experiment, the author conducted not only with the difference in lighting but also with variation in facial expression. Through using the learning set information, combine with two experiments, the author had acquired the error rate on the test set.\n",

A comparison was made between the result of each method in each experiment; through the comparison, the reader can see which test is better and more appropriate for image recognition. Although the author only conducted only two experiments, in each experiment, the images are under different lighting condition, combine with different facial expression and glasses recognition, which made the author’s result was are highly persuasive.\n"

In addition, besides face recognition, Fisherfaces method can be used in a wide variation area such as autonomous vehicles which use the image from a learning set to identify activities on the road to determine which action should be executed, furthermore, the method can be used to monitor forest activity by using the original forest as a learning set and monitor which happen at each coordinate to prevent forest fires and poaching.\n",

To use facial biometrics, we have to calculate the Euclidean distance matrix between vectors of the training set, set the value of diagonal elements to infinity by placing a sizeable numeric value, then sort distance matrix in ascending order\n"

Also, by dividing the information into different sections, the reader can easily follow the information the author wanted to deliver, which make the paper had an exquisite presentation style. Furthermore, to support their argument, the author always gives concrete evidence to support their argument. In conclusion, the paper contained a depth argument, but with an exquisite style of presentation, the reader can easily follow the argument and understand what the author wants to deliver."
