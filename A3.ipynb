However, nowadays, a meme is currently known as a concept or a catchphrase which spread from one to another person through social networks, community, forums or blogs. Memes also share common characteristics with infectious diseases because just from one person, a meme could be share with many different people."

        "    A meme becomes viral when its appeal to many people and make them share it on the internet. Also, sharing on the internet is a lot like other kinds of social sharing. However, sharing through the internet or social sharing are both affected by emotion. Emotionally positive articles were likely to be shared than those that were emotionally negative. However, a very negative article was more likely to be shared than the one that was only mildly positive. So, article sharing not only affected by positive or negative emotion but also, how arousing that emotion was. Also, humans tend to make decisions base on other people decision instead of gather information then make your own decision, so when one person said the meme was good, then some other person will agree with that, then it will continue and make the meme go viral."
