        "A meme becomes viral when its appeal to many people and make them share it on the internet. Also, sharing on the internet is a lot like other kinds of social sharing. However, sharing through the internet or social sharing are both affected by emotion. Emotionally positive articles were likely to be shared than those that were emotionally negative. Furthermore, a very negative article was more likely to be shared than the one that was only mildly positive. Because negaive emotions give more impact on people, rather than positive ones. So sharing article do not affect people through giving positive or negative emotions, but also through the level of arousing that emotion is. Also, humans tend to make decisions based on other people decision instead of gathering information then make your own decision. So when one person said the meme was good, then another person will agree with that, then it will continue and make the meme go viral.\n",
