However, nowadays, a meme is currently known as a concept or a catchphrase which spread from one to another person through social networks, community, forums or blogs. Memes also share common characteristics with infectious diseases because just from one person, a meme could be share with many different people."

        "    A meme becomes viral when its appeal to many people and make them share it on the internet. Also, sharing on the internet is a lot like other kinds of social sharing. However, sharing through the internet or social sharing are both affected by emotion. Emotionally positive articles were likely to be shared than those that were emotionally negative. However, a very negative article was more likely to be shared than the one that was only mildly positive. So, article sharing not only affected by positive or negative emotion but also, how arousing that emotion was. Also, humans tend to make decisions base on other people decision instead of gather information then make your own decision, so when one person said the meme was good, then some other person will agree with that, then it will continue and make the meme go viral."

The first one is audience size, audience size is shown through the number of users which had interacted with the meme, and the user neighbours can be considered as the potential audience; for example, user who had a high number of followers tend to have more neighbour who can become potential audience than user which have low number of followers. Secondly is the community structure, community structure is pattern how the audience is sharing the meme with their neighbour, by explore the pattern, user can compare the meme's appeal and predict its virality. Lastly, this approach also shows the user how fast the meme is spreading.\n",

The reason they used Twitter is due to Twitter contains a large number of memes which are generated and shared every day, and Twitter had a concrete network structure to share and spread the meme. Furthermore, they choose Twitter based on the interactions between a pair of user (u, v) which are u can follow v to see u activities, u can retweet v's tweet to post it on u's news feed and u can mention v's screen name by using \"@\" symbol like \"@v\" (Weng et al. 2014).\n",
